# Small script to see your time logs in Jira

## How to:

   - run `jira-logs.sh` and follow the instructions:
   - install dependencies (2)
   - create token (3)
   - each time you want to run app and check your time entries hit (1) - no previous steps needed

OR

   - Go to `jira-work-log`
   - Run  `yarn install` (if you don't have `yarn` - run `npm install --global yarn` first)
   - Create `.env ` file and declare `token`. i.e:(`token=123456abc`)
   - run `yarn start`.
   - Browser window will open automatically.
